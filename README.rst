Installation
============

The stable releases are uploaded to `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org>`_, so
you can install and upgrade using ``pip``::

  pip install omni

Alternatively, you can install development versions —at your own risk—
directly from the Git repository::

  pip install -e git://github.com/aperezdc/omni

Configuration

Development

3. Send a pull request for review.
